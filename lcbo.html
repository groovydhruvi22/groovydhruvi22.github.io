                    The LCBO operates retail stores, as well as an online platform, offering a wide range of alcoholic
                    products including wine, beer, spirits, and other related items. It regulates and controls the sale,
                    purchase, and consumption of alcoholic beverages in Ontario while promoting responsible drinking.

                                The LCBO is facing a significant problem of increasing theft of select products from
                                three categories, which has resulted in a loss of approximately $77 million in 2018. The
                                repeated occurrence of theft of these select products poses a threat to the financial
                                stability and reputation of the LCBO. Furthermore, the increasing frequency of theft
                                incidents raises concerns for the safety of store employees. Therefore, there is an
                                urgent need to identify the root cause(s) of this problem and develop effective
                                solutions to mitigate the impact of theft on the LCBO's revenue, reputation, and
                                employee safety.

                                Our proposed solution is to implement an in-store ordering system to reduce the theft of
                                select products in three categories that are causing significant financial loss. This
                                solution involves keeping the most stolen products in storage and providing customers
                                with access to an iPad-based ordering system, allowing them to place orders for these
                                products. The store staff will then bring the requested products to the customer service
                                desk, ensuring that the products are not accessible to potential thieves. This solution
                                addresses the root cause of the problem and provides a safer shopping experience for
                                customers and employees, while also protecting the financial interests and reputation of
                                the LCBO.

                    During this project, it was crucial to prioritize the needs of end users — LCBO's customers.
                    Simultaneously, as a designer, it was equally vital to comprehend and address the specific
                    requirements and objectives of the company. Striking a balance between user-centric design and
                    aligning with the business goals ensured a successful outcome.

                    While developing the in-store requesting app, I recognized that it was going to impose a burden on
                    our customers. However, I made it a priority to keep this in mind throughout the design process,
                    aiming to minimize any inconvenience or challenges they might face.

                    During the project, it was surprising to discover that a significant portion of LCBO's customer base
                    consisted of older individuals who may not be as comfortable with technology. This insight played a
                    crucial role in designing the in-store requesting app. To cater to their needs, I focused on keeping
                    the user interface intuitive and the user flow as straightforward as possible. By prioritizing ease
                    of use, I aimed to make the app accessible and inclusive for all users, regardless of their level of
                    tech-savviness.
